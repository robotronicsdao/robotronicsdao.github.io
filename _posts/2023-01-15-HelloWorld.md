## Welcome
Why did I create this blog? First of all, I would like to improve my writing skills, perfect my English, finally keep of my financial situation from a student with no money to (hopefully) financially independent. Occasionally share my thoughts on robotics and automation, etc...

Let me introduce myself, my name is Del Asimov, I am a robotics engineering student, I have always been
curious and a lover of history, technology, engineering and space. Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic started, not knowing what to do with my time at home, I got into personal finance and discovered the world of FIRE philosophy. Boredom due to the restrictions of the pandemic also led me to delve into the world of cryptocurrencies, so I started investing in crypto, now my assets are about $1,000. 

So I hope you will share this with me.
